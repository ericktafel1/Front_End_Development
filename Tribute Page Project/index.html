        <h1>Edward Snowden Tribute Page</h1>
        <p id="tribute-info">Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June 21st, 1983. He is an American former computer intelligence consultant who is most known for leaking highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013. During his time as an employee and subcontractor, he revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. This has sparked a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy around the globe.</p>
